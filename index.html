        COO â€“ It important we donâ€™t have a carryover of the first half of the year, 
        the effect of this is that we might not get it done second half of the year.
         Even if we do not meet up with 100% records, we should be as closed as 
         possible to meeting the all deadlines. More so, we should ensure we send 
         all reports needs. Important to all managers that ideas is not execution. 
        Social media- ran adds for tsf, and also confirmed that she got her laptop
         for which really meets all her expectations. COO ello, all social media post 
         must be approved befor posting on the group created to boys.
